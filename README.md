JQuery / JS  : Monsters demo
========================

An example I used when teaching jquery basics and oriented object JavaScript.

Visit the final step [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/plancien/jquery-monsters-tutorial/master/level_8.html).

If you want to use it as an exercise :
* visit every level page to observe what's going on.
* go and watch level 1 page
* don't look at the html / css code, and try to code something similar by yourself.
* when it's done, or if you are stuck, you can look at source files
* don't go to level 2 until you understand every line in level 1 files
* do the same for the following levels
